  title: Amazon Location Service Routes V2
  description: |-
    With the Amazon Location Routes API you can calculate routes and estimate travel time based on up-to-date road network and live traffic information.

    Calculate optimal travel routes and estimate travel times using up-to-date road network and traffic data. Key features include:

      * Point-to-point routing with estimated travel time, distance, and turn-by-turn directions

      * Multi-point route optimization to minimize travel time or distance

      * Route matrices for efficient multi-destination planning

      * Isoline calculations to determine reachable areas within specified time or distance thresholds

      * Map-matching to align GPS traces with the road network
