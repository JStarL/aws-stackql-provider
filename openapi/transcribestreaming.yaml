  title: Amazon Transcribe Streaming Service
  description: |-
    Amazon Transcribe streaming offers four main types of real-time transcription: **Standard** , **Medical** , **Call Analytics** , and **Health Scribe**.

      * **Standard transcriptions** are the most common option. Refer to for details.

      * **Medical transcriptions** are tailored to medical professionals and incorporate medical terms. A common use case for this service is transcribing doctor-patient dialogue in real time, so doctors can focus on their patient instead of taking notes. Refer to for details.

      * **Call Analytics transcriptions** are designed for use with call center audio on two different channels; if you're looking for insight into customer service calls, use this option. Refer to for details.

      * **HealthScribe transcriptions** are designed to automatically create clinical notes from patient-clinician conversations using generative AI. Refer to [here] for details.

  /medical-scribe-stream:
    post:
      operationId: StartMedicalScribeStream
      description: |-
        Starts a bidirectional HTTP/2 stream, where audio is streamed to Amazon Web Services HealthScribe and the transcription results are streamed to your application.

        When you start a stream, you first specify the stream configuration in a `MedicalScribeConfigurationEvent`. This event includes channel definitions, encryption settings, and post-stream analytics settings, such as the output configuration for aggregated transcript and clinical note generation. These are additional streaming session configurations beyond those provided in your initial start request headers. Whether you are starting a new session or resuming an existing session, your first event must be a `MedicalScribeConfigurationEvent`.

        After you send a `MedicalScribeConfigurationEvent`, you start `AudioEvents` and Amazon Web Services HealthScribe responds with real-time transcription results. When you are finished, to start processing the results with the post-stream analytics, send a `MedicalScribeSessionControlEvent` with a `Type` of `END_OF_SESSION` and Amazon Web Services HealthScribe starts the analytics.

        You can pause or resume streaming. To pause streaming, complete the input stream without sending the `MedicalScribeSessionControlEvent`. To resume streaming, call the `StartMedicalScribeStream` and specify the same SessionId you used to start the stream.

        The following parameters are required:

          * `language-code`

          * `media-encoding`

          * `media-sample-rate-hertz`

        For more information on streaming with Amazon Web Services HealthScribe, see [Amazon Web Services HealthScribe](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/health-scribe-streaming.html).

            If you include `IdentifyLanguage`, you must include a list of language
            codes, using `LanguageOptions`, that you think may be present in your
            audio stream.


            You can also include a preferred language using `PreferredLanguage`. Adding
            a preferred language can help Amazon Transcribe identify the language
            faster than if you omit this parameter.


            If you have multi-channel audio that contains different languages on each
            channel, and you''ve enabled channel identification, automatic language
            identification identifies the dominant language on each audio channel.


            Note that you must include either `LanguageCode` or `IdentifyLanguage`
            or `IdentifyMultipleLanguages` in your request. If you include more than
            one of these parameters, your transcription job fails.


            Streaming language identification can''t be combined with custom language
            models or redaction.'
