  title: Private CA Connector for SCEP
  description: |-
    Connector for SCEP creates a connector between Amazon Web Services Private CA and your SCEP-enabled clients and devices. For more information, see [Connector for SCEP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/scep-connector.htmlconnector-for-scep.html) in the _Amazon Web Services Private CA User Guide_.

      description: |-
        For general-purpose connectors. Creates a _challenge password_ for the specified connector. The SCEP protocol uses a challenge password to authenticate a request before issuing a certificate from a certificate authority (CA). Your SCEP clients include the challenge password as part of their certificate request to Connector for SCEP. To retrieve the connector Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for the connectors in your account, call [ListConnectors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/C4SCEP_API/pca-connector-scep/latest/APIReference/API_ListConnectors.html).

        To create additional challenge passwords for the connector, call `CreateChallenge` again. We recommend frequently rotating your challenge passwords.
