    This is the _Amazon Q Business_ API Reference. Amazon Q Business is a fully managed, generative-AI powered enterprise chat assistant that you can deploy within your organization. Amazon Q Business enhances employee productivity by supporting key tasks such as question-answering, knowledge discovery, writing email messages, summarizing text, drafting document outlines, and brainstorming ideas. Users ask questions of Amazon Q Business and get answers that are presented in a conversational manner. For an introduction to the service, see the [ _Amazon Q Business User Guide_ ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/business-use-dg/what-is.html).

    For an overview of the Amazon Q Business APIs, see [Overview of Amazon Q Business API operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/business-use-dg/api-ref.html#api-overview).

    For information about the IAM access control permissions you need to use this API, see [IAM roles for Amazon Q Business](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/business-use-dg/iam-roles.html) in the _Amazon Q Business User Guide_.

        Creates an Amazon Q Business application.

        There are new tiers for Amazon Q Business. Not all features in Amazon Q Business Pro are also available in Amazon Q Business Lite. For information on what's included in Amazon Q Business Lite and what's included in Amazon Q Business Pro, see [Amazon Q Business tiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/tiers.html#user-sub-tiers). You must use the Amazon Q Business console to assign subscription tiers to users.

        An Amazon Q Apps service linked role will be created if it's absent in the Amazon Web Services account when `QAppsConfiguration` is enabled in the request. For more information, see [ Using service-linked roles for Q Apps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/using-service-linked-roles-qapps.html).

        When you create an application, Amazon Q Business may securely transmit data for processing from your selected Amazon Web Services region, but within your geography. For more information, see [Cross region inference in Amazon Q Business](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/cross-region-inference.html).

        Creates a new data accessor for an ISV to access data from a Amazon Q Business application. The data accessor is an entity that represents the ISV's access to the Amazon Q Business application's data. It includes the IAM role ARN for the ISV, a friendly name, and a set of action configurations that define the specific actions the ISV is allowed to perform and any associated data filters. When the data accessor is created, an IAM Identity Center application is also created to manage the ISV's identity and authentication for accessing the Amazon Q Business application.

        Deletes a group so that all users and sub groups that belong to the group can no longer access documents only available to that group. For example, after deleting the group "Summer Interns", all interns who belonged to that group no longer see intern-only documents in their chat results.

        If you want to delete, update, or replace users or sub groups of a group, you need to use the `PutGroup` operation. For example, if a user in the group "Engineering" leaves the engineering team and another user takes their place, you provide an updated list of users or sub groups that belong to the "Engineering" group when calling `PutGroup`.

        Create, or updates, a mapping of users—who have access to a document—to groups.

        You can also map sub groups to groups. For example, the group "Company Intellectual Property Teams" includes sub groups "Research" and "Engineering". These sub groups include their own list of users or people who work in these teams. Only users who work in research and engineering, and therefore belong in the intellectual property group, can see top-secret company documents in their Amazon Q Business chat results.

        There are two options for creating groups, either passing group members inline or using an S3 file via the S3PathForGroupMembers field. For inline groups, there is a limit of 1000 members per group and for provided S3 files there is a limit of 100 thousand members. When creating a group using an S3 file, you provide both an S3 file and a `RoleArn` for Amazon Q Buisness to access the file.

        Provides information on boosting supported Amazon Q Business document attribute types. When an end user chat query matches document attributes that have been boosted, Amazon Q Business prioritizes generating responses from content that matches the boosted document attributes.

        For `STRING` and `STRING_LIST` type document attributes to be used for boosting on the console and the API, they must be enabled for search using the [DocumentAttributeConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_DocumentAttributeConfiguration.html) object of the [UpdateIndex](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_UpdateIndex.html) API. If you haven't enabled searching on these attributes, you can't boost attributes of these data types on either the console or the API.

        For more information on how boosting document attributes work in Amazon Q Business, see [Boosting using document attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/business-use-dg/metadata-boosting.html).
