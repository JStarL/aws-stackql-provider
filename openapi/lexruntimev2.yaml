    delete:
      operationId: DeleteSession
      description: |-
        Removes session information for a specified bot, alias, and user ID.

        You can use this operation to restart a conversation with a bot. When you remove a session, the entire history of the session is removed so that you can start again.

        You don't need to delete a session. Sessions have a time limit and will expire. Set the session time limit when you create the bot. The default is 5 minutes, but you can specify anything between 1 minute and 24 hours.

        If you specify a bot or alias ID that doesn't exist, you receive a `BadRequestException.`

        If the locale doesn't exist in the bot, or if the locale hasn't been enables for the alias, you receive a `BadRequestException`.

        Returns session information for a specified bot, alias, and user.

        For example, you can use this operation to retrieve session information for a user that has left a long-running session in use.

        If the bot, alias, or session identifier doesn't exist, Amazon Lex V2 returns a `BadRequestException`. If the locale doesn't exist or is not enabled for the alias, you receive a `BadRequestException`.

      description: "Starts an HTTP/2 bidirectional event stream that enables you to\
        \ send audio, text, or DTMF input in real time. After your application starts\
        \ a conversation, users send input to Amazon Lex V2 as a stream of events.\
        \ Amazon Lex V2 processes the incoming events and responds with streaming\
        \ text or audio events.\n\nAudio input must be in the following format: `audio/lpcm\
        \ sample-rate=8000 sample-size-bits=16 channel-count=1; is-big-endian=false`.\n\
        \nIf the optional post-fulfillment response is specified, the messages are\
        \ returned as follows. For more information, see [PostFulfillmentStatusSpecification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/API_PostFulfillmentStatusSpecification.html).\n\
        \n  * **Success message** \\- Returned if the Lambda function completes successfully\
        \ and the intent state is fulfilled or ready fulfillment if the message is\
        \ present.\n\n  * **Failed message** \\- The failed message is returned if\
        \ the Lambda function throws an exception or if the Lambda function returns\
        \ a failed intent state without a message.\n\n  * **Timeout message** \\-\
        \ If you don't configure a timeout message and a timeout, and the Lambda function\
        \ doesn't return within 30 seconds, the timeout message is returned. If you\
        \ configure a timeout, the timeout message is returned when the period times\
        \ out. \n\nFor more information, see [Completion message](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/streaming-progress.html#progress-complete.html).\n\
        \nIf the optional update message is configured, it is played at the specified\

        \ is active. If the fulfillment update message is not active, the Lambda function\
