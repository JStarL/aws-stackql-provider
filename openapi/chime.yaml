  description: "**Most of these APIs are no longer supported and will not be updated.**\
    \ We recommend using the latest versions in the [Amazon Chime SDK API reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/APIReference/welcome.html),\
    \ in the Amazon Chime SDK.\n\nUsing the latest versions requires migrating to\
    \ dedicated namespaces. For more information, refer to [Migrating from the Amazon\
    \ Chime namespace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/dg/migrate-from-chm-namespace.html)\
    \ in the _Amazon Chime SDK Developer Guide_.\n\nThe Amazon Chime application programming\
    \ interface (API) is designed so administrators can perform key tasks, such as\
    \ creating and managing Amazon Chime accounts, users, and Voice Connectors. This\
    \ guide provides detailed information about the Amazon Chime API, including operations,\
    \ types, inputs and outputs, and error codes.\n\nYou can use an AWS SDK, the AWS\
    \ Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the REST API to make API calls for Amazon\
    \ Chime. We recommend using an AWS SDK or the AWS CLI. The page for each API action\
    \ contains a _See Also_ section that includes links to information about using\
    \ the action with a language-specific AWS SDK or the AWS CLI.\n\nUsing an AWS\
    \ SDK\n\n    \n\nYou don't need to write code to calculate a signature for request\
    \ authentication. The SDK clients authenticate your requests by using access keys\
    \ that you provide. For more information about AWS SDKs, see the [AWS Developer\
    \ Center](http://aws.amazon.com/developer/).\n\nUsing the AWS CLI\n\n    \n\n\
    Use your access keys with the AWS CLI to make API calls. For information about\
    \ setting up the AWS CLI, see [Installing the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)\
    \ in the _AWS Command Line Interface User Guide_. For a list of available Amazon\
    \ Chime commands, see the [Amazon Chime commands](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/chime/index.html)\
    \ in the _AWS CLI Command Reference_.\n\nUsing REST APIs\n\n    \n\nIf you use\
    \ REST to make API calls, you must authenticate your request by providing a signature.\
    \ Amazon Chime supports Signature Version 4. For more information, see [Signature\
    \ Version 4 Signing Process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html)\
    \ in the _Amazon Web Services General Reference_.\n\nWhen making REST API calls,\
    \ use the service name `chime` and REST endpoint `https://service.chime.aws.amazon.com`.\n\
    \nAdministrative permissions are controlled using AWS Identity and Access Management\
    \ (IAM). For more information, see [Identity and Access Management for Amazon\
    \ Chime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ag/security-iam.html) in the\
    \ _Amazon Chime Administration Guide_."

        Users suspended from a `Team` account are disassociated from the account,but they can continue to use Amazon Chime as free users. To remove the suspension from suspended `Team` account users, invite them to the `Team` account again. You can use the InviteUsers action to do so.

        Users suspended from an `EnterpriseLWA` account are immediately signed out of Amazon Chime and can no longer sign in. To remove the suspension from suspended `EnterpriseLWA` account users, use the BatchUnsuspendUser action.

        To sign out users without suspending them, use the LogoutUser action.

        Updates to outbound calling names can take up to 72 hours to complete. Pending updates to outbound calling names must be complete before you can request another update.
