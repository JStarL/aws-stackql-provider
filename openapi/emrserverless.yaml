    Amazon EMR Serverless is a new deployment option for Amazon EMR. Amazon EMR Serverless provides a serverless runtime environment that simplifies running analytics applications using the latest open source frameworks such as Apache Spark and Apache Hive. With Amazon EMR Serverless, you donâ€™t have to configure, optimize, secure, or operate clusters to run applications with these frameworks.

    The API reference to Amazon EMR Serverless is `emr-serverless`. The `emr-serverless` prefix is used in the following scenarios:

      * It is the prefix in the CLI commands for Amazon EMR Serverless. For example, `aws emr-serverless start-job-run`.

      * It is the prefix before IAM policy actions for Amazon EMR Serverless. For example, `"Action": ["emr-serverless:StartJobRun"]`. For more information, see [Policy actions for Amazon EMR Serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-Serverless-UserGuide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-actions).

      * It is the prefix used in Amazon EMR Serverless service endpoints. For example, `emr-serverless.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`.
