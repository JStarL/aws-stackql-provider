  title: Amazon S3 Tables
  description: |-
    An Amazon S3 table represents a structured dataset consisting of tabular data in [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/) format and related metadata. This data is stored inside an S3 table as a subresource. All tables in a table bucket are stored in the [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/) table format. Through integration with the [Amazon Web Services Glue Data Catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https:/docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/catalog-and-crawler.html) you can interact with your tables using Amazon Web Services analytics services, such as [Amazon Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https:/docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/) and [Amazon Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https:/docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/). Amazon S3 manages maintenance of your tables through automatic file compaction and snapshot management. For more information, see [Amazon S3 table buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-tables-buckets.html).
