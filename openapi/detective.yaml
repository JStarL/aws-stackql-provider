  title: Amazon Detective
  description: |-
    Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help you to analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) workloads. Detective automatically extracts time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.

    The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of member accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator account.

    To add a member account to the behavior graph, the administrator account sends an invitation to the account. When the account accepts the invitation, it becomes a member account in the behavior graph.

    Detective is also integrated with Organizations. The organization management account designates the Detective administrator account for the organization. That account becomes the administrator account for the organization behavior graph. The Detective administrator account is also the delegated administrator account for Detective in Organizations.

    The Detective administrator account can enable any organization account as a member account in the organization behavior graph. The organization accounts do not receive invitations. The Detective administrator account can also invite other accounts to the organization behavior graph.

    Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to manage behavior graphs that belong to the Region that is associated with the currently selected endpoint.

    The administrator account for a behavior graph can use the Detective API to do the following:

      * Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new behavior graph.

      * View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.

      * Add member accounts to a behavior graph.

      * Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.

      * Apply tags to a behavior graph.

    The organization management account can use the Detective API to select the delegated administrator for Detective.

    The Detective administrator account for an organization can use the Detective API to do the following:

      * Perform all of the functions of an administrator account.

      * Determine whether to automatically enable new organization accounts as member accounts in the organization behavior graph.

    An invited member account can use the Detective API to do the following:

      * View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.

      * Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.

      * Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.

      * Remove their account from a behavior graph.

    All API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See [Logging Detective API Calls with CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/userguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html).

    We replaced the term "master account" with the term "administrator account". An administrator account is used to centrally manage multiple accounts. In the case of Detective, the administrator account manages the accounts in their behavior graph.

        Creates a new behavior graph for the calling account, and sets that account as the administrator account. This operation is called by the account that is enabling Detective.

        The operation also enables Detective for the calling account in the currently selected Region. It returns the ARN of the new behavior graph.

        `CreateGraph` triggers a process to create the corresponding data tables for the new behavior graph.

        An account can only be the administrator account for one behavior graph within a Region. If the same account calls `CreateGraph` with the same administrator account, it always returns the same behavior graph ARN. It does not create a new behavior graph.

      description: |-
        `CreateMembers` is used to send invitations to accounts. For the organization behavior graph, the Detective administrator account uses `CreateMembers` to enable organization accounts as member accounts.

        For invited accounts, `CreateMembers` sends a request to invite the specified Amazon Web Services accounts to be member accounts in the behavior graph. This operation can only be called by the administrator account for a behavior graph.

        `CreateMembers` verifies the accounts and then invites the verified accounts. The administrator can optionally specify to not send invitation emails to the member accounts. This would be used when the administrator manages their member accounts centrally.

        For organization accounts in the organization behavior graph, `CreateMembers` attempts to enable the accounts. The organization accounts do not receive invitations.

        The request provides the behavior graph ARN and the list of accounts to invite or to enable.

        The response separates the requested accounts into two lists:

          * The accounts that `CreateMembers` was able to process. For invited accounts, includes member accounts that are being verified, that have passed verification and are to be invited, and that have failed verification. For organization accounts in the organization behavior graph, includes accounts that can be enabled and that cannot be enabled.

          * The accounts that `CreateMembers` was unable to process. This list includes accounts that were already invited to be member accounts in the behavior graph.

        For organization accounts in the organization behavior graph, the Detective administrator account can always enable the organization account again. Organization accounts that are not enabled as member accounts are not included in the `ListMembers` results for the organization behavior graph.

        An administrator account cannot use `DeleteMembers` to remove their own account from the behavior graph. To disable a behavior graph, the administrator account uses the `DeleteGraph` API method.

        Removes the Detective administrator account in the current Region. Deletes the organization behavior graph.

        Can only be called by the organization management account.

        Removing the Detective administrator account does not affect the delegated administrator account for Detective in Organizations.

        To remove the delegated administrator account in Organizations, use the Organizations API. Removing the delegated administrator account also removes the Detective administrator account in all Regions, except for Regions where the Detective administrator account is the organization management account.

        Designates the Detective administrator account for the organization in the current Region.

        If the account does not have Detective enabled, then enables Detective for that account and creates a new behavior graph.

        Can only be called by the organization management account.

        If the organization has a delegated administrator account in Organizations, then the Detective administrator account must be either the delegated administrator account or the organization management account.

        If the organization does not have a delegated administrator account in Organizations, then you can choose any account in the organization. If you choose an account other than the organization management account, Detective calls Organizations to make that account the delegated administrator account for Detective. The organization management account cannot be the delegated administrator account.
