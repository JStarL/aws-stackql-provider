            \ corresponding sensitive data discovery result isn't available in the\

            \ an unsupported storage format. Macie can't verify the location of the\

            \ location of the sensitive data to retrieve.\n\n  * MEMBER_ROLE_TOO_PERMISSIVE\
            \ - The trust or permissions policy for the IAM role in the affected member\
            \ account doesn't meet Macie requirements for restricting access to the\
