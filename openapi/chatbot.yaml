    The _AWS Chatbot API Reference_ provides descriptions, API request parameters, and the XML response for each of the AWS Chatbot API actions.

    AWS Chatbot APIs are currently available in the following Regions:

      * US East (Ohio) - `us-east-2`

      * US West (Oregon) - `us-west-2`

      * Asia Pacific (Singapore) - `ap-southeast-1`

      * Europe (Ireland) - `eu-west-1`

    The AWS Chatbot console can only be used in US East (Ohio). Your configuration data however, is stored in each of the relevant available Regions.

    Your AWS CloudTrail events are logged in whatever Region you call from, not US East (N. Virginia) by default.
