    The Amazon Q Apps feature capability within Amazon Q Business allows web experience users to create lightweight, purpose-built AI apps to fulfill specific tasks from within their web experience. For example, users can create a Q App that exclusively generates marketing-related content to improve your marketing team's productivity or a Q App for writing customer emails and creating promotional content using a certain style of voice, tone, and branding. For more information on the capabilities, see [Amazon Q Apps capabilities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/deploy-experience-iam-role.html#q-apps-actions) in the _Amazon Q Business User Guide_.
