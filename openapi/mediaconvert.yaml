        When you choose Match video duration, MediaConvert pads the output audio streams
        with silence or trims them to ensure that the total duration of each audio
        stream is at least as long as the total duration of the video stream. After
        padding or trimming, the audio stream duration is no more than one frame longer
        than the video stream. MediaConvert applies audio padding or trimming only
        to the end of the last segment of the output. For unsegmented outputs, MediaConvert
        adds padding only to the end of the file. When you keep the default value,

            You can optionally specify your time delta in milliseconds instead of

            the right number of bits to use for each part of the video to maintain
            the video quality that you specify. When you keep the default value, AUTO,
            MediaConvert picks a quality level for you, based on characteristics of
            your input video. If you prefer to specify a quality level, specify a
            number from 1 through 10. Use higher numbers for greater quality. Level
            10 results in nearly lossless compression. The quality level for most
            broadcast-quality transcodes is between 6 and 9. Optionally, to specify
            a value between whole numbers, also provide a value for the setting qvbrQualityLevelFineTune.

        this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on areas of the frame that aren''t
        moving and uses more bits on complex objects with sharp edges that move a
        lot. For example, this feature improves the readability of text tickers on

        always improve your video quality. Note, though, that this feature doesn''t
        take into account where the viewer''s attention is likely to be. If viewers
        are likely to be focusing their attention on a part of the screen that doesn''t

      description: Use these settings only when you use Kantar watermarking. Specify
        the values that MediaConvert uses to generate and place Kantar watermarks

        differences between video and audio. For this situation, choose Match video
        duration. In all other cases, keep the default value, Default codec duration.
        When you choose Match video duration, MediaConvert pads the output audio streams
        with silence or trims them to ensure that the total duration of each audio
        stream is at least as long as the total duration of the video stream. After
        padding or trimming, the audio stream duration is no more than one frame longer
        than the video stream. MediaConvert applies audio padding or trimming only
        to the end of the last segment of the output. For unsegmented outputs, MediaConvert
        adds padding only to the end of the file. When you keep the default value,
        any minor discrepancies between audio and video duration will depend on your
        output audio codec.

            Drop duplicate. For numerically complex conversions, to avoid stutter:
            Choose Interpolate. This results in a smooth picture, but might introduce
            undesirable video artifacts. For complex frame rate conversions, especially
            if your source video has already been converted from its original cadence:
            Choose FrameFormer to do motion-compensated interpolation. FrameFormer
            uses the best conversion method frame by frame. Note that using FrameFormer
            increases the transcoding time and incurs a significant add-on cost. When
            you choose FrameFormer, your input video resolution must be at least 128x96.
            To create an output with the same number of frames as your input: Choose
            Maintain frame count. When you do, MediaConvert will not drop, interpolate,
            add, or otherwise change the frame count from your input to your output.
            Note that since the frame count is maintained, the duration of your output
            will become shorter at higher frame rates and longer at lower frame rates.'

        the encoder uses fewer bits on areas that can sustain more distortion with
        no noticeable visual degradation and uses more bits on areas where any small
        distortion will be noticeable. For example, complex textured blocks are encoded
        with fewer bits and smooth textured blocks are encoded with more bits. Enabling
        this feature will almost always improve your video quality. Note, though,
