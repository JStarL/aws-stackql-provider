  title: Amazon CloudSearch Domain
  description: |-
    You use the AmazonCloudSearch2013 API to upload documents to a search domain and search those documents.

    The endpoints for submitting `UploadDocuments`, `Search`, and `Suggest` requests are domain-specific. To get the endpoints for your domain, use the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service `DescribeDomains` action. The domain endpoints are also displayed on the domain dashboard in the Amazon CloudSearch console. You submit suggest requests to the search endpoint.

    For more information, see the [Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide).

      description: |-
        Retrieves autocomplete suggestions for a partial query string. You can use suggestions enable you to display likely matches before users finish typing. In Amazon CloudSearch, suggestions are based on the contents of a particular text field. When you request suggestions, Amazon CloudSearch finds all of the documents whose values in the suggester field start with the specified query string. The beginning of the field must match the query string to be considered a match.

        For more information about configuring suggesters and retrieving suggestions, see [Getting Suggestions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide/getting-suggestions.html) in the _Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide_.

        The endpoint for submitting `Suggest` requests is domain-specific. You submit suggest requests to a domain's search endpoint. To get the search endpoint for your domain, use the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service `DescribeDomains` action. A domain's endpoints are also displayed on the domain dashboard in the Amazon CloudSearch console.

      description: |-
        Posts a batch of documents to a search domain for indexing. A document batch is a collection of add and delete operations that represent the documents you want to add, update, or delete from your domain. Batches can be described in either JSON or XML. Each item that you want Amazon CloudSearch to return as a search result (such as a product) is represented as a document. Every document has a unique ID and one or more fields that contain the data that you want to search and return in results. Individual documents cannot contain more than 1 MB of data. The entire batch cannot exceed 5 MB. To get the best possible upload performance, group add and delete operations in batches that are close the 5 MB limit. Submitting a large volume of single-document batches can overload a domain's document service.

        The endpoint for submitting `UploadDocuments` requests is domain-specific. To get the document endpoint for your domain, use the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service `DescribeDomains` action. A domain's endpoints are also displayed on the domain dashboard in the Amazon CloudSearch console.

            \n  * `buckets` specifies an array of the facet values or ranges to count.\
            \ Ranges are specified using the same syntax that you use to search for\
            \ a range of values. For more information, see [ Searching for a Range\
            \ of Values](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide/searching-ranges.html)\
            \ in the _Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide_. Buckets are returned in\
            \ the order they are specified in the request. The `sort` and `size` options\
            \ are not valid if you specify `buckets`.\n\n  * `size` specifies the\
            \ maximum number of facets to include in the results. By default, Amazon\
            \ CloudSearch returns counts for the top 10. The `size` parameter is only\
            \ valid when you specify the `sort` option; it cannot be used in conjunction\
            \ with `buckets`.\n\n  * `sort` specifies how you want to sort the facets\
            \ in the results: `bucket` or `count`. Specify `bucket` to sort alphabetically\
            \ or numerically by facet value (in ascending order). Specify `count`\
            \ to sort by the facet counts computed for each facet value (in descending\
            \ order). To retrieve facet counts for particular values or ranges of\
            \ values, use the `buckets` option instead of `sort`. \n\nIf no facet\
            \ options are specified, facet counts are computed for all field values,\
            \ the facets are sorted by facet count, and the top 10 facets are returned\
            \ in the results.\n\nTo count particular buckets of values, use the `buckets`\
            \ option. For example, the following request uses the `buckets` option\
            \ to calculate and return facet counts by decade.\n\n` {\"year\":{\"buckets\"\
            :[\"[1970,1979]\",\"[1980,1989]\",\"[1990,1999]\",\"[2000,2009]\",\"[2010,}\"\
            ]}} `\n\nTo sort facets by facet count, use the `count` option. For example,\
            \ the following request sets the `sort` option to `count` to sort the\
            \ facet values by facet count, with the facet values that have the most\
            \ matching documents listed first. Setting the `size` option to 3 returns\
            \ only the top three facet values.\n\n` {\"year\":{\"sort\":\"count\"\
            ,\"size\":3}} `\n\nTo sort the facets by value, use the `bucket` option.\
            \ For example, the following request sets the `sort` option to `bucket`\
            \ to sort the facet values numerically by year, with earliest year listed\
            \ first.\n\n` {\"year\":{\"sort\":\"bucket\"}} `\n\nFor more information,\

            }.`\n\nThe options you can configure vary according to which parser you\
            \ use:\n\n  * `defaultOperator`: The default operator used to combine\
            \ individual terms in the search string. For example: `defaultOperator:\
            \ 'or'`. For the `dismax` parser, you specify a percentage that represents\

            \ match, rather than a default operator. A value of `0%` is the equivalent\

            \ `structured`, `lucene`) or `100` (`dismax`). Valid for: `simple`, `structured`,\
            \ `lucene`, and `dismax`.\n  * `fields`: An array of the fields to search\
            \ when no fields are specified in a search. If no fields are specified\
            \ in a search and this option is not specified, all text and text-array\

            \ relevance scores. To specify a field weight, append a caret (`^`) symbol\

            \ of the `title` field over the `description` field you could specify:\
            \ `\"fields\":[\"title^5\",\"description\"]`. Valid values: The name of\

            \ Default: All `text` and `text-array` fields. Valid for: `simple`, `structured`,\
            \ `lucene`, and `dismax`.\n  * `operators`: An array of the operators\
            \ or special characters you want to disable for the simple query parser.\
            \ If you disable the `and`, `or`, or `not` operators, the corresponding\
            \ operators (`+`, `|`, `-`) have no special meaning and are dropped from\
            \ the search string. Similarly, disabling `prefix` disables the wildcard\
            \ operator (`*`) and disabling `phrase` disables the ability to search\
            \ for phrases by enclosing phrases in double quotes. Disabling precedence\
            \ disables the ability to control order of precedence using parentheses.\
            \ Disabling `near` disables the ability to use the ~ operator to perform\
            \ a sloppy phrase search. Disabling the `fuzzy` operator disables the\
            \ ability to use the ~ operator to perform a fuzzy search. `escape` disables\
            \ the ability to use a backslash (`\\`) to escape special characters within\
            \ the search string. Disabling whitespace is an advanced option that prevents\
            \ the parser from tokenizing on whitespace, which can be useful for Vietnamese.\
            \ (It prevents Vietnamese words from being split incorrectly.) For example,\
            \ you could disable all operators other than the phrase operator to support\
            \ just simple term and phrase queries: `\"operators\":[\"and\",\"not\"\
            ,\"or\", \"prefix\"]`. Valid values: `and`, `escape`, `fuzzy`, `near`,\

            \ All operators and special characters are enabled. Valid for: `simple`.\n\
            \  * `phraseFields`: An array of the `text` or `text-array` fields you\
            \ want to use for phrase searches. When the terms in the search string\
            \ appear in close proximity within a field, the field scores higher. You\
            \ can specify a weight for each field to boost that score. The `phraseSlop`\
            \ option controls how much the matches can deviate from the search string\
            \ and still be boosted. To specify a field weight, append a caret (`^`)\
            \ symbol and the weight to the field name. For example, to boost phrase\
            \ matches in the `title` field over the `abstract` field, you could specify:\
            \ `\"phraseFields\":[\"title^3\", \"plot\"]` Valid values: The name of\
            \ any `text` or `text-array` field and an optional numeric value greater\
            \ than zero. Default: No fields. If you don't specify any fields with\
            \ `phraseFields`, proximity scoring is disabled even if `phraseSlop` is\
            \ specified. Valid for: `dismax`.\n  * `phraseSlop`: An integer value\
            \ that specifies how much matches can deviate from the search phrase and\
            \ still be boosted according to the weights specified in the `phraseFields`\
            \ option; for example, `phraseSlop: 2`. You must also specify `phraseFields`\
            \ to enable proximity scoring. Valid values: positive integers. Default:\
            \ 0. Valid for: `dismax`.\n  * `explicitPhraseSlop`: An integer value\
            \ that specifies how much a match can deviate from the search phrase when\
            \ the phrase is enclosed in double quotes in the search string. (Phrases\
            \ that exceed this proximity distance are not considered a match.) For\
            \ example, to specify a slop of three for dismax phrase queries, you would\
            \ specify `\"explicitPhraseSlop\":3`. Valid values: positive integers.\
            \ Default: 0. Valid for: `dismax`.\n  * `tieBreaker`: When a term in the\
            \ search string is found in a document's field, a score is calculated\
            \ for that field based on how common the word is in that field compared\
            \ to other documents. If the term occurs in multiple fields within a document,\
            \ by default only the highest scoring field contributes to the document's\
            \ overall score. You can specify a `tieBreaker` value to enable the matches\
            \ in lower-scoring fields to contribute to the document's score. That\
            \ way, if two documents have the same max field score for a particular\
            \ term, the score for the document that has matches in more fields will\
            \ be higher. The formula for calculating the score with a tieBreaker is\
            \ `(max field score) + (tieBreaker) * (sum of the scores for the rest\
            \ of the matching fields)`. Set `tieBreaker` to 0 to disregard all but\
            \ the highest scoring field (pure max): `\"tieBreaker\":0`. Set to 1 to\
            \ sum the scores from all fields (pure sum): `\"tieBreaker\":1`. Valid\
            \ values: 0.0 to 1.0. Default: 0.0. Valid for: `dismax`."
