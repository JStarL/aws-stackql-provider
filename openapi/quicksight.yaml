        Creates and starts a new SPICE ingestion for a dataset. You can manually refresh datasets in an Enterprise edition account 32 times in a 24-hour period. You can manually refresh datasets in a Standard edition account 8 times in a 24-hour period. Each 24-hour period is measured starting 24 hours before the current date and time.

        Any ingestions operating on tagged datasets inherit the same tags automatically for use in access control. For an example, see [How do I create an IAM policy to control access to Amazon EC2 resources using tags?](http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/iam-ec2-resource-tags/) in the Amazon Web Services Knowledge Center. Tags are visible on the tagged dataset, but not on the ingestion resource.

      description: |-
        Creates Amazon QuickSight customizations for the current Amazon Web Services Region. Currently, you can add a custom default theme by using the `CreateAccountCustomization` or `UpdateAccountCustomization` API operation. To further customize Amazon QuickSight by removing Amazon QuickSight sample assets and videos for all new users, see [Customizing Amazon QuickSight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/customizing-quicksight.html) in the _Amazon QuickSight User Guide._

        You can create customizations for your Amazon Web Services account or, if you specify a namespace, for a QuickSight namespace instead. Customizations that apply to a namespace always override customizations that apply to an Amazon Web Services account. To find out which customizations apply, use the `DescribeAccountCustomization` API operation.

        Before you use the `CreateAccountCustomization` API operation to add a theme as the namespace default, make sure that you first share the theme with the namespace. If you don't share it with the namespace, the theme isn't visible to your users even if you make it the default theme. To check if the theme is shared, view the current permissions by using the ` [DescribeThemePermissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeThemePermissions.html) ` API operation. To share the theme, grant permissions by using the ` [UpdateThemePermissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateThemePermissions.html) ` API operation.

      description: "Describes the customizations associated with the provided Amazon\
        \ Web Services account and Amazon Amazon QuickSight namespace in an Amazon\
        \ Web Services Region. The Amazon QuickSight console evaluates which customizations\
        \ to apply by running this API operation with the `Resolved` flag included.\n\
        \nTo determine what customizations display when you run this command, it can\
        \ help to visualize the relationship of the entities involved.\n\n  * `Amazon\
        \ Web Services account` \\- The Amazon Web Services account exists at the\
        \ top of the hierarchy. It has the potential to use all of the Amazon Web\
        \ Services Regions and Amazon Web Services Services. When you subscribe to\
        \ Amazon QuickSight, you choose one Amazon Web Services Region to use as your\
        \ home Region. That's where your free SPICE capacity is located. You can use\
        \ Amazon QuickSight in any supported Amazon Web Services Region. \n\n  * `Amazon\
        \ Web Services Region` \\- In each Amazon Web Services Region where you sign\
        \ in to Amazon QuickSight at least once, Amazon QuickSight acts as a separate\
        \ instance of the same service. If you have a user directory, it resides in\
        \ us-east-1, which is the US East (N. Virginia). Generally speaking, these\
        \ users have access to Amazon QuickSight in any Amazon Web Services Region,\
        \ unless they are constrained to a namespace. \n\nTo run the command in a\
        \ different Amazon Web Services Region, you change your Region settings. If\
        \ you're using the CLI, you can use one of the following options:\n\n    *\
        \ Use [command line options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-options.html).\
        \ \n\n    * Use [named profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html).\
        \ \n\n    * Run `aws configure` to change your default Amazon Web Services\
        \ Region. Use Enter to key the same settings for your keys. For more information,\
        \ see [Configuring the CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).\n\
        \n  * `Namespace` \\- A QuickSight namespace is a partition that contains\
        \ users and assets (data sources, datasets, dashboards, and so on). To access\
        \ assets that are in a specific namespace, users and groups must also be part\
        \ of the same namespace. People who share a namespace are completely isolated\
        \ from users and assets in other namespaces, even if they are in the same\
        \ Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Web Services Region.\n\n  * `Applied\
        \ customizations` \\- Within an Amazon Web Services Region, a set of Amazon\
        \ QuickSight customizations can apply to an Amazon Web Services account or\
        \ to a namespace. Settings that you apply to a namespace override settings\
        \ that you apply to an Amazon Web Services account. All settings are isolated\
        \ to a single Amazon Web Services Region. To apply them in other Amazon Web\
        \ Services Regions, run the `CreateAccountCustomization` command in each Amazon\
        \ Web Services Region where you want to apply the same customizations."

        Creates an Amazon QuickSight account, or subscribes to Amazon QuickSight Q.

        The Amazon Web Services Region for the account is derived from what is configured in the CLI or SDK.

        Before you use this operation, make sure that you can connect to an existing Amazon Web Services account. If you don't have an Amazon Web Services account, see [Sign up for Amazon Web Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/setting-up-aws-sign-up.html) in the _Amazon QuickSight User Guide_. The person who signs up for Amazon QuickSight needs to have the correct Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions. For more information, see [IAM Policy Examples for Amazon QuickSight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/iam-policy-examples.html) in the _Amazon QuickSight User Guide_.

        If your IAM policy includes both the `Subscribe` and `CreateAccountSubscription` actions, make sure that both actions are set to `Allow`. If either action is set to `Deny`, the `Deny` action prevails and your API call fails.

        You can't pass an existing IAM role to access other Amazon Web Services services using this API operation. To pass your existing IAM role to Amazon QuickSight, see [Passing IAM roles to Amazon QuickSight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security-create-iam-role) in the _Amazon QuickSight User Guide_.

        You can't set default resource access on the new account from the Amazon QuickSight API. Instead, add default resource access from the Amazon QuickSight console. For more information about setting default resource access to Amazon Web Services services, see [Setting default resource access to Amazon Web Services services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/scoping-policies-defaults.html) in the _Amazon QuickSight User Guide_.

      description: |-
        Deletes an analysis from Amazon QuickSight. You can optionally include a recovery window during which you can restore the analysis. If you don't specify a recovery window value, the operation defaults to 30 days. Amazon QuickSight attaches a `DeletionTime` stamp to the response that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Amazon QuickSight deletes the analysis permanently.

        At any time before recovery window ends, you can use the `RestoreAnalysis` API operation to remove the `DeletionTime` stamp and cancel the deletion of the analysis. The analysis remains visible in the API until it's deleted, so you can describe it but you can't make a template from it.

        An analysis that's scheduled for deletion isn't accessible in the Amazon QuickSight console. To access it in the console, restore it. Deleting an analysis doesn't delete the dashboards that you publish from it.

        Creates a dashboard from either a template or directly with a `DashboardDefinition`. To first create a template, see the ` [CreateTemplate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTemplate.html) ` API operation.

        A dashboard is an entity in Amazon QuickSight that identifies Amazon QuickSight reports, created from analyses. You can share Amazon QuickSight dashboards. With the right permissions, you can create scheduled email reports from them. If you have the correct permissions, you can create a dashboard from a template that exists in a different Amazon Web Services account.

        (Enterprise edition only) Creates a new namespace for you to use with Amazon QuickSight.

        A namespace allows you to isolate the Amazon QuickSight users and groups that are registered for that namespace. Users that access the namespace can share assets only with other users or groups in the same namespace. They can't see users and groups in other namespaces. You can create a namespace after your Amazon Web Services account is subscribed to Amazon QuickSight. The namespace must be unique within the Amazon Web Services account. By default, there is a limit of 100 namespaces per Amazon Web Services account. To increase your limit, create a ticket with Amazon Web ServicesSupport.

        Creates a template either from a `TemplateDefinition` or from an existing Amazon QuickSight analysis or template. You can use the resulting template to create additional dashboards, templates, or analyses.

        A _template_ is an entity in Amazon QuickSight that encapsulates the metadata required to create an analysis and that you can use to create s dashboard. A template adds a layer of abstraction by using placeholders to replace the dataset associated with the analysis. You can use templates to create dashboards by replacing dataset placeholders with datasets that follow the same schema that was used to create the source analysis and template.

        Generates an embed URL that you can use to embed an Amazon QuickSight dashboard or visual in your website, without having to register any reader users. Before you use this action, make sure that you have configured the dashboards and permissions.

        The following rules apply to the generated URL:

          * It contains a temporary bearer token. It is valid for 5 minutes after it is generated. Once redeemed within this period, it cannot be re-used again.

          * The URL validity period should not be confused with the actual session lifetime that can be customized using the ` [SessionLifetimeInMinutes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser.html#QS-GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser-request-SessionLifetimeInMinutes) ` parameter. The resulting user session is valid for 15 minutes (minimum) to 10 hours (maximum). The default session duration is 10 hours.

          * You are charged only when the URL is used or there is interaction with Amazon QuickSight.

          * They can be used one time only.

          * They are valid for 5 minutes after you run this command.

          * You are charged only when the URL is used or there is interaction with Amazon QuickSight.

          * The resulting user session is valid for 15 minutes (default) up to 10 hours (maximum). You can use the optional `SessionLifetimeInMinutes` parameter to customize session duration.

        For more information, see [Embedding Analytics Using GetDashboardEmbedUrl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/embedded-analytics-deprecated.html) in the _Amazon QuickSight User Guide_.

        For more information about the high-level steps for embedding and for an interactive demo of the ways you can customize embedding, visit the [Amazon QuickSight Developer Portal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/quicksight-dev-portal.html).

        Generates a session URL and authorization code that you can use to embed the Amazon Amazon QuickSight console in your web server code. Use `GetSessionEmbedUrl` where you want to provide an authoring portal that allows users to create data sources, datasets, analyses, and dashboards. The users who access an embedded Amazon QuickSight console need belong to the author or admin security cohort. If you want to restrict permissions to some of these features, add a custom permissions profile to the user with the ` [UpdateUser](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateUser.html) ` API operation. Use ` [RegisterUser](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterUser.html) ` API operation to add a new user with a custom permission profile attached. For more information, see the following sections in the _Amazon QuickSight User Guide_ :

      operationId: TagResource
      description: |-
        Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified Amazon QuickSight resource.

        Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. You can use the `TagResource` operation with a resource that already has tags. If you specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the resource. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the resource, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag.

        You can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource. Amazon QuickSight supports tagging on data set, data source, dashboard, template, topic, and user.

        Tagging for Amazon QuickSight works in a similar way to tagging for other Amazon Web Services services, except for the following:

          * Tags are used to track costs for users in Amazon QuickSight. You can't tag other resources that Amazon QuickSight costs are based on, such as storage capacoty (SPICE), session usage, alert consumption, or reporting units.

          * Amazon QuickSight doesn't currently support the tag editor for Resource Groups.

        Creates an Amazon QuickSight user whose identity is associated with the Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity or role specified in the request. When you register a new user from the Amazon QuickSight API, Amazon QuickSight generates a registration URL. The user accesses this registration URL to create their account. Amazon QuickSight doesn't send a registration email to users who are registered from the Amazon QuickSight API. If you want new users to receive a registration email, then add those users in the Amazon QuickSight console. For more information on registering a new user in the Amazon QuickSight console, see [ Inviting users to access Amazon QuickSight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/managing-users.html#inviting-users).

      description: |-
        Predicts existing visuals or generates new visuals to answer a given query.

        This API uses [trusted identity propagation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/trustedidentitypropagation.html) to ensure that an end user is authenticated and receives the embed URL that is specific to that user. The IAM Identity Center application that the user has logged into needs to have [trusted Identity Propagation enabled for Amazon QuickSight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/trustedidentitypropagation-using-customermanagedapps-specify-trusted-apps.html) with the scope value set to `quicksight:read`. Before you use this action, make sure that you have configured the relevant Amazon QuickSight resource and permissions.

        We recommend enabling the `QSearchStatus` API to unlock the full potential of `PredictQnA`. When `QSearchStatus` is enabled, it first checks the specified dashboard for any existing visuals that match the question. If no matching visuals are found, `PredictQnA` uses generative Q&A; to provide an answer. To update the `QSearchStatus`, see [UpdateQuickSightQSearchConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateQuickSightQSearchConfiguration.html).

        Starts an Asset Bundle export job.

        An Asset Bundle export job exports specified Amazon QuickSight assets. You can also choose to export any asset dependencies in the same job. Export jobs run asynchronously and can be polled with a `DescribeAssetBundleExportJob` API call. When a job is successfully completed, a download URL that contains the exported assets is returned. The URL is valid for 5 minutes and can be refreshed with a `DescribeAssetBundleExportJob` API call. Each Amazon QuickSight account can run up to 5 export jobs concurrently.

        The API caller must have the necessary permissions in their IAM role to access each resource before the resources can be exported.

    post:
      operationId: StartDashboardSnapshotJob
      description: |-
        Starts an asynchronous job that generates a snapshot of a dashboard's output. You can request one or several of the following format configurations in each API call.

          * 1 Paginated PDF

          * 1 Excel workbook that includes up to 5 table or pivot table visuals

          * 5 CSVs from table or pivot table visuals

        The status of a submitted job can be polled with the `DescribeDashboardSnapshotJob` API. When you call the `DescribeDashboardSnapshotJob` API, check the `JobStatus` field in the response. Once the job reaches a `COMPLETED` or `FAILED` status, use the `DescribeDashboardSnapshotJobResult` API to obtain the URLs for the generated files. If the job fails, the `DescribeDashboardSnapshotJobResult` API returns detailed information about the error that occurred.

        **StartDashboardSnapshotJob API throttling**

        Amazon QuickSight utilizes API throttling to create a more consistent user experience within a time span for customers when they call the `StartDashboardSnapshotJob`. By default, 12 jobs can run simlutaneously in one Amazon Web Services account and users can submit up 10 API requests per second before an account is throttled. If an overwhelming number of API requests are made by the same user in a short period of time, Amazon QuickSight throttles the API calls to maintin an optimal experience and reliability for all Amazon QuickSight users.

        **Common throttling scenarios**

        The following list provides information about the most commin throttling scenarios that can occur.

          * **A large number of`SnapshotExport` API jobs are running simultaneously on an Amazon Web Services account.** When a new `StartDashboardSnapshotJob` is created and there are already 12 jobs with the `RUNNING` status, the new job request fails and returns a `LimitExceededException` error. Wait for a current job to comlpete before you resubmit the new job.

          * **A large number of API requests are submitted on an Amazon Web Services account.** When a user makes more than 10 API calls to the Amazon QuickSight API in one second, a `ThrottlingException` is returned.

        If your use case requires a higher throttling limit, contact your account admin or [Amazon Web ServicesSupport](http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/) to explore options to tailor a more optimal expereince for your account.

        **Best practices to handle throttling**

        If your use case projects high levels of API traffic, try to reduce the degree of frequency and parallelism of API calls as much as you can to avoid throttling. You can also perform a timing test to calculate an estimate for the total processing time of your projected load that stays within the throttling limits of the Amazon QuickSight APIs. For example, if your projected traffic is 100 snapshot jobs before 12:00 PM per day, start 12 jobs in parallel and measure the amount of time it takes to proccess all 12 jobs. Once you obtain the result, multiply the duration by 9, for example `(12 minutes * 9 = 108 minutes)`. Use the new result to determine the latest time at which the jobs need to be started to meet your target deadline.

        The time that it takes to process a job can be impacted by the following factors:

          * The dataset type (Direct Query or SPICE).

          * The size of the dataset.

          * The complexity of the calculated fields that are used in the dashboard.

          * The number of visuals that are on a sheet.

          * The types of visuals that are on the sheet.

          * The number of formats and snapshots that are requested in the job configuration.

          * The size of the generated snapshots.
